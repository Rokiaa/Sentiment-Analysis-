# Sentiment_Analysis with python
Sentiment analysis is a common NLP task, which involves classifying texts or parts of texts into a pre-defined sentiment</br>
We will install NLTK and download the sample tweets that we will use to train and test our model this is the **corpora** And then we will use the negative and positive tweets to train our model.</br>
Then we will make a **Normalization** which is the process of converting a word to its canonical form.</br>
In Normalization we will make lemmatization to convert word to its normalized form, and then we will clean it from stopwords and punctuations.</br>
We will apply **Binarized multinomial naive bayes Algorithm** where the frequencies of the words don't play a key role in our calssification.</br>
Then we will use the test data to compute the percentage of how our algorithm make correct detect</br>
We can get sentence and then classify it if it was positive or not</br>
